<p>By clicking on the link at the end of this page you will confirm your acceptance of these terms and conditions.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>BTS:</strong> Backstage Technical Services/Backstage/Backstage Club</li>
    <li><strong>Crew:</strong> the member(s) of BTS assigned to an event</li>
    <li><strong>Union:</strong> Bath University Students Union</li>

</ul>
<ol>
    <h2>Bookings</h2>
    <li>BTS try to accommodate all requests for the provision of their services but they are not obliged to do so in any circumstances. In particular their
        availability will be limited during exam times and they will often be unable to provide services on dates upon which they already have a booking.
    </li>
    <li>All requests for bookings must be placed online via the online booking form. Thereafter a provisional quote will be provided by BTS. This may be subject
        to change.
    </li>
    <li>No contract shall be created unless and until BTS accepts the booking request and subsequently issue a booking confirmation via email, is issued by a
        committee member, stating that the event is confirmed.
    </li>
    <h2>Costs and Fees</h2>
    <li>BTS are a non-profit making organisation. BTS will issue a production charge for each event depending upon what exactly is involved and the nature and
        extent of services required. There may also be other costs (see clause 5). In each case a quote will be given which will include the production charge
        and subsequently confirmed, subject to clause 2 above.
    </li>
    <li>The costs charged may include the following but this list is not intended to be exhaustive:
        <ul>
            <li>the cost of all transport, (for the Crew and Equipment) to and from the venue to attend the Event</li>
            <li>the cost of the hire and insurance of any equipment hired by BTS for the Event, (although all arrangements will be made by BTS)</li>
            <li>the transport costs in attending any pre-event venue inspection if this is deemed necessary, (for example to assess its suitability, verify the
                size of a stage, check power supply etc)
            </li>
        </ul>
        If a pre-event venue inspection takes place and it is determined that BTS cannot/will not provide their services, (for example because the venue is
        deemed unsuitable), BTS may recover the reasonable costs that they incurred in carrying out the pre-event venue inspection. This may either be by
        retaining any sum charged by them in advance in connection with the inspection or by subsequently raising an invoice to cover such costs. In the latter
        case the client shall be liable to pay the invoice within 30 days.
    </li>
    <li>In circumstances where transport for the Crew and/or Equipment to and from the Event is needed, BTS will try to arrange for a BTS Union vehicle driver
        to handle this. However if a BTS Union vehicle driver is not available then the Client will either need to arrange such transport, (e.g. by providing a
        Union Driver in the case of a Union event), or they will be charged for this as mentioned above, (if private transport is used this will normally be at
        the current Union rates.
    </li>
    <li>Late Bookings are those taken with less than 2 weeks notice. A late booking fee may be charged in such cases at BTS's discretion.</li>
    <li>BTS may require in its discretion that the total costs of providing its services are paid up front, (either in full or in part), either prior to an
        Event taking place or at the time of the booking being taken.
    </li>
    <li>Subject to clause 8 above BTS will issue an invoice setting out the applicable fees. All invoices are payable on receipt and no later than 30 days after
        they are received by the Client, even if the Client has an arrangement with another person whereby payment is to be made by that person. BTS reserve the
        right to charge interest on invoices which are not paid within 30 days of dispatch from the date on which payment of their invoice was due, until the
        date of actual payment. The current rate of interest is 2% above the HSBC base rate.
    </li>
    <h2>Cancellation of BTS' Services</h2>
    <li>If a booking/event is cancelled by the client for whatever reason, all unrecoverable costs incurred will be paid by the Client and a further
        cancellation fee of up to 100% of the total fees payable may be charged to the Client at BTSâ€™s discretion.
    </li>
    <li>BTS reserve the right to cancel any booking taken up to one week before the date of the Event. In which case any fees paid in advance will be returned
        in full but no additional sums of any kind shall be payable to the Client by way of compensation, damages and/or breach of contract.
    </li>
    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <li>Crews are expected to work to statutory safety guidelines. Under no circumstances should they be asked or encouraged to break them.</li>
    <li>Whenever potentially dangerous special effects (such as but not limited to pyrotechnics, strobes, smoke etc), are used, such use must be strictly
        supervised at all times by an experienced Crew member/s who shall ensure compliance with legal requirements including any applicable Local Authority
        Guidelines.
    </li>
    <li>The Client must ensure that the venue is properly cleared and/or prepared for BTS and the services and/or the Equipment. If a stage, platform, rigging,
        scaffolding or other structure of any kind is to be erected the Client must firstly ensure that the foundations upon which the structure is to be
        erected is sufficiently firm and otherwise suitable to safely carry the structure and weight to be put on it before the Crew start erection. The Client
        shall be strictly liable for any loss, costs, and/or damages of any nature which BTS and/or the Union and/or the University may suffer as a result of
        the Client's failure to carry out its obligations herein.

        BTS. If the Client wants the Crew to use, rig, de-rig, assist with such matters or otherwise use or handle any such kit/apparatus equipment or items
        they must firstly provide proof of adequate insurance.
    </li>
    <li>The Crew will exercise all proper care to ensure that the Equipment which it erects and/or sets up is safe and is properly constructed for the purpose
        for which it has been requested by the Client and that it complies with all relevant legal requirements. BTS will also take care when setting up and
        dismantling Equipment to prevent any damage to the Client's or other relevant property, but neither BTS nor the Union nor the University of Bath shall
        be responsible for any such damage howsoever caused.

        or in connection with the provision of BTS's, except where such claims are due to BTS's negligence.
    </li>
    <li>The Client shall use the Equipment at their own risk and shall indemnify BTS and the Union and University of Bath against any claims or other such
        matters referred to in clause 17 above, such indemnity to include but not be limited to, the costs of any legal or other professional fees and of

    <li>If the Equipment or part thereof is damaged, by misuse, negligence or otherwise, through no fault of BTS during the Event, the Client shall be
        responsible for the full cost of repairing and/or replacing the Equipment or part thereof and agrees that such sum may be recoverable as a debt.
    </li>
    <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
    <li>BTS shall be relieved of its contractual obligations in the event that performance thereof is prevented or delayed directly or indirectly by an act of
        God, war, riot, strike, labour disturbance, industrial dispute, fire, flood, explosion, severe weather conditions, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,
