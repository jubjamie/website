<p>This form allows you to create new user accounts that can access the Backstage website.</p>

<h3>Single vs Multiple</h3>

<p>While the default form is pretty it isn't particularly practical for creating lots of users. If you need to create a lot of accounts "in bulk"
    then switch to "Multiple Users" mode.</p>

<p>Simply enter each user's name and username into the textarea, separated by a new line, in the form <code>Forename Surname,username</code>.</p>

<p>The user's email address will automatically be set to their bath.ac.uk email, using their username, and they will be given a randomly-generated
    password.</p>

<h3>User Account Types</h3>

<p>Both Single and Multiple User modes allow you to customise the type of account each user will be given.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Standard</dt>
    <dd>A normal Backstage member. These can access all the usual areas.</dd>
    <dt>Committee</dt>
    <dd>On top of all the functionality of "Standard" members, these also have access to the admin functions. These users aren't linked to the
        committee page.
    </dd>
    <dt>Associate</dt>
    <dd>Associates have the same permissions as "Standard" members - they just appear in various member lists as associates.</dd>
    <dt>SU Officer</dt>
    <dd>Members of the SU are restricted in what they can access - they are only given a very basic overview of our events diary.</dd>
